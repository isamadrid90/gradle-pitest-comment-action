This action makes easier to include mutation testing as a part of a Github Action pipeline.

If you find this action useful let me know by adding a ‚≠ê this encourage me to keep working on it.

Happy to hear any suggestions or improvements.

What it does ‚ùì
============

The purpose of this action is to execute pitest, upload the report as an artifact and
add a comment with the summary of the execution

Prerequisites üìù
============

* Gradle
* PITest plugin

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("info.solidsoft.pitest") version "1.7.0"
}
```

* PITest configuration working in local, here an example:

```kotlin
pitest {
    setProperty("junit5PluginVersion", "0.12")
    setProperty("targetClasses", listOf("package-to-check"))
    setProperty("outputFormats", listOf("HTML")) //this is important because it will update it as an artifact
}
```
